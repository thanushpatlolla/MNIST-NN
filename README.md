Implemented a neural network from scratch in NumPy for image classification on the MNIST dataset. 
Pretty standard, used ReLU, He initialization, standard mini-batch gradient descent. 
Overall quite informative on learning the intuition for backpropagation, but PyTorch is much more convenient
Final Test Accuracy: 97.94%
